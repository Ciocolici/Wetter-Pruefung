# Wetter Pr√ºfung
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project. My first, actually, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. The app asks the user for the current weather condition ("sonnig" or "regnerisch") and the temperature. Based on the input, it recommends what to wear and whether to bring an umbrella.

The code was written independently by me. The class provided only general instructions (see the comments inside Program.cs), so this was my first experience building something entirely from scratch.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Wetter Pruefung.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
