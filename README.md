# Wetter-Pruefung
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App project. My first, actually. It asks the user about the weather, and depending on the answer(s), it gives recommendations on what to wear. 

Open "Wetter Pruefung.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Wetter Pruefung.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0". 

Note: german language used.
