# Wetter Pr√ºfung
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project. My first, actually, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. It asks the user about the weather, and depending on the answer(s), it gives recommendations on what to wear. 

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Wetter Pruefung.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
