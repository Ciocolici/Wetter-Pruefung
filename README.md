# Wetter Pr√ºfung
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project. My first, actually, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. The app asks the user for the current weather condition ("sonnig" or "regnerisch") and the temperature. Based on the input, it recommends what to wear and whether to bring an umbrella.

The entire logic and code were implemented independently by me, based on instructions provided in class (see comments in Program.cs).
This was my introduction to writing real code from scratch.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Wetter Pruefung.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
